# Working With SynExtend

The SynExtend R package was originally built as a set of tools for
building out lists of orthologous gene pairs from biological data,
though it has since expanded. It is currently a work in progress. The
provided workflow here is a simple example built to showcase usage and
outputs of the orthology prediction tools housed within. The most
unfinished part of this workflow is in the `SelectByK` function that
uses a naive k-means approach to drop assumed false positive pairs.

The original idea of this work was to provide high quality orthology
inference tools to improve hypothesis generation post pair inference,
and this workflow will be updated as new use cases can be accessed with
these inferences. Currently the only task included here is a brief
observation of the placement of pseudogenes as a percentage of coding
genes on a phylogenetic tree.

## Initial workspace setup and known TODO list

This workflow is loading in four ad-hoc functions:

- An updated version of the function `SelectByK` within `SynExtend`.
- A function for providing context to orthologous pairs.
- A function that is serving as a helper for `gffToDataFrame` in lieu of
  itâ€™s impending reformatting.
- A helper function for organizing the shared core orthologs.

A small TODO list for `SynExtend` includes updates to the function
`gffToDataFrame` to improve usage with eukaryotes generally and with
splice variants specifically, and adjustments to the `PairSummaries`
function to take advantage of forking within R and make slightly more
harmonious choices with pseudogene alignments.

## Data Collection Part 1

The NCBI [Edirect](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK179288/) tools
can be used to collect small or large sets of data, and are the only
non-R dependency in this workflow currently. In this case a small
example set of bacterial genomes and their annotations can be selected.
The genus currently denoted by the `Selection` variable in the code
chunk below was selected partially on a whim, but also partially because
it creates a modestly sized data set with a reasonable amount of
diversity, at least a few other convenient single genera sets like this
exist. This example workflow runs within a manageable time frame on a
MBP with modest specs. This initial data gathering step can be performed
in almost any manner generally, as long as matched FNA and GFF files are
the initial input to the workflow.

## Build a Synteny Map

See the DECIPHER documentation for further reading. This is a modestly
diverse set of genomes within the same genera, and what we see subset of
the data in the below pairs plot, combined with a general summary of
syntenic hits is that though they share reasonable amounts of ordered
information, those individual blocks of order are still pretty
fractious. This is a modestly difficult test case for our tools in this
workflow.

``` r
Syn01 <- FindSynteny(dbFile = DBPATH,
                     verbose = TRUE,
                     processors = NULL)
```

## Build Predicted Pairs

Reconcile syntenic hits with gene calls to build out an initial list of
predicted pairs.

## State of the Data

Some of these predictions are good, some are bad, and we have somewhat
limited data available to evaluate these pairings. In the `P01` object,
columns 3-8 represent generalized information about the blocks of
information that led to the prediction, while columns 10, 11, and 12
represent general evaluations of the pairings themselves. The initial
object here is relatively large and pairs plots can be somewhat
excessive, so to avoid stressing out our graphics devices we will sample
only 50,000 rows.

## Evaluate Predicted Pairs

As seen in the above histogram, predicted pairs span the range of
available PIDs. Where users choose to threshold their PIDs is a
complicated series of value judgements based on their downstream needs,
and confidence preferences, however hard cutoffs are often inappropriate
for the data generated herein. To give users at least some tools to
avoid a hard threshold and effectively drop bad predictions, the
`SelectByK` function was constructed to use a K-means approach where
users provide a PID confidence that signifies the **lowest PID centroid
at which a cluster represents TRUE pairings**.

``` r
# the ReturnAllCommunities argument is set to TRUE here to allow us to illustrate
# where the function is dropping predicted pairs
P02 <- suppressWarnings(SelectByK(Pairs = P01,
                                  ClusterScalar = 4L, # default is 1, though that isn't likely to be aligned with user preferences
                                  UserConfidence = 0.5, # this is the PID that the cluster centroid must be above to be retained
                                  Verbose = TRUE,
                                  ShowPlot = TRUE,
                                  ReturnAllCommunities = TRUE))
```

    # Time difference of 15.12634 mins

# reset GC01 with the attribute from the initial summaries, we're splitting these out in an attempt to keep our objects within reasonable size limits
GC01 <- attr(x = P01,
             which = "GeneCalls")
```

## Evaluated Clusters

We can evaluate the identified clusters with a histogram in relation to
the user cutoff and show the outcome of the selection. The total number
of clusters selected by `SelectByK` is a function of the `ClusterScalar`
argument and the initial input data.

``` r
P03 <- P02[[2]]
P02 <- P02[[1]]

plts <- vector(mode = "list",
               length = length(P03))
maxcounts <- vector(mode = "integer",
                    length = length(P03))
brks <- seq(from = 0,
            to = 1,
            by = 0.01)

for (m1 in seq_along(P03)) {
  plts[[m1]] <- hist(P03[[m1]][, "PID"],
                     breaks = brks,
                     plot = FALSE)
  maxcounts[m1] <- max(plts[[m1]]$counts)
}

o1 <- order(maxcounts, decreasing = TRUE)

plts <- plts[o1]

for (m1 in seq_along(plts)) {
  if (m1 > 1L) {
    plot(plts[[m1]],
         col = ColVec4[m1],
         add = TRUE)
  } else {
    plot(plts[[m1]],
         col = ColVec4[m1],
         xlab = "PID",
         ylab = "Frequency",
         main = "Clustered Predictions")
  }
}

```

## Building a simple phylogeny

We can collect the single-linkage sets of pairs for further evaluation.
Though a variety of tools exist that allow us to perform community
detection on the single-linkage sets, we are foregoing them here for
simplicity. Some tools like [MCL](https://github.com/micans/mcl) perform
this task before proceeding to their algorithm, will others, like the
methods present in [igraph](https://igraph.org/) will attempt to
evaluate the entire graph they are given, regardless of whether
evaluations on distinct disjoint sets would be a more
resource-appropriate choice.

``` r
# this is a simple implementation of union-merge to get our disjoint sets
Sets01 <- DisjointSet(Pairs = P02,
                      Verbose = TRUE)

## Build another simple tree

We can proxy another dendrogram from the synteny map relatively easily,
and compare it to our core genome phylogeny. This specific example isnâ€™t
a particularly useful exploration, but gives a brief example of how to
set up tree comparisons, and implement some tree distance comparisons in
`SynExtend`.

``` r
SynDist <- matrix(data = 0,
                  nrow = nrow(Syn01),
                  ncol = ncol(Syn01))
for (m1 in seq_len(nrow(Syn01) - 1L)) {
  for (m2 in (m1 + 1L):nrow(Syn01)) {
    y1 <- sum(Syn01[[m1, m1]])
    y2 <- sum(Syn01[[m2, m2]])
    ph1 <- 1 - ((sum(Syn01[[m1, m2]][, 4L]) * 2L) / (y1 + y2))
    if (ph1 < 1) {
      ph1 <- 0
    }
    SynDist[m1, m2] <- SynDist[m2, m1] <- 1 - ((sum(Syn01[[m1, m2]][, 4L]) * 2L) / (y1 + y2))
  }
}
SynDend <- TreeLine(myDistMatrix = SynDist,
                    method = "NJ")
```

## Pseudogenes by phylogeny

We can visualize the percent of coding sequences with a noted internal
stop (blue) or frameshift (red) against our generated phylogeny, while
coloring the tips based on a rough extraction of the reporting
sequencing technologies used.

  if (is.leaf(x)) {
    # is a terminal partition / leaf / tip

## Current End of workflow

Save off our data, add anything that is too large for github our
`.gitignore` file, and print out some session information. From here
data like this is in a reasonable state to use for a variety of
downstream computational biology tasks. As more functionality is added
to `SynExtend`, more examples and plots will be added to this repo.
Currently this workflow is easily manageable on a recent model Macbook
Pro with 12 Cores and 64GB of RAM.
